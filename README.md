**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

My first ever ReactJs project.
My goal with this project was to learn React.js while using an API (https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2). As this was my very first React project, I did not work at all on design nor responsiveness but solely on the react/javascript logic.

This repository is a side project displaying the beer catalogue of the Brewdog brewery.
